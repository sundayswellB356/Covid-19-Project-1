  <h2>Where Did The Coronavirus 2019 Come From</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus
        disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus
        was first identified from an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed,
        allowing the virus to spread to other areas of China and later worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO)
        declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11
        March 2020. As of 6 September 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 605 million cases and 6.5 million
        confirmed deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history.<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a></p>

      <h2>What Were The Restrictions Put in Place By The Government?</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Ireland has been in lockdown for nearly six weeks now but as of May 5, some coronavirus restrictions will be
        eased slightly,

        With people across the country confined to their homes for weeks there was a sigh of relief last week when the
        government revealed their road map for taking the country out of lockdown in the coming months,

        While strict measures will remain in place for another two weeks, May 18 will mark the first of five phases in
        the government's bid to return to normality.

        Here's a timeline of when Ireland's battle to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>

      <h2>What Impact Did Coronavirus 2019 Have On The Irish Economy?</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a deep impact on the Irish economy, leading it into a recession. Essential public
        health measures announced by the Irish Government to contain the spread of COVID-19 resulted in the largest
        monthly increase in unemployment in the history of the Republic of Ireland during March 2020.[1][2] By 24 April,
        there were more than one million people in receipt of support interventions to the labour market, including
        those in receipt of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy
        Scheme.[3][4] While there were job losses in all sectors, individuals working in tourism, hospitality, food and
        retail have seen the largest job losses.[5][6]</p>
