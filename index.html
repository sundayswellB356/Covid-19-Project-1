    <p>The virus first appeared on a small scale in November 2019 with the first large cluster appearing in Wuhan, China in December 2019.  It was first thought SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan, China’s open-air “wet markets.” Later theories voiced concern that it may have originated as a biological weapon in a lab in China.</p>
