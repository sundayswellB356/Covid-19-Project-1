The Coronavirus 2019 And beyond!

Maeve Brophy.
Introduction To My Project 1
The reasoning behind my reason for doing this project was. The impact on everyday restrictions on people’s lives. 

As humans been confined, and told to lock-down, due to a pandemic is alien to us humans. I witnessed losing loved-ones, and having to stand outside during their funeral, a very upsetting position to be in. 

I want to share with you, how this pandemic, interrupted people’s lives, not been able to have a basic commodity as a haircut. 
This Pandemic virus will go into, the history books for people who have not lived, through the pandemic. My aim is to highlight the impact:
The origins of The Coronavirus 2019
On our Front-line Staff.
The Impact of our Economy. 
The Timeframe for Economic Recovery Our Government Put in Place. 
The Impact of Our Mental Health during and after restrictions were lifted. 
The Long-Term affect that having the virus created. 

The Structure Plane:
I setup sections in my project.
Section 1:	Where Coronavirus Originated From?
Section 2:	Our Government’s Timeframe to Recovery.
Section 3:	Our Economy and the Impact Coronavirus 19 had.
Section 4:	The Coronavirus impact on our Front-line staff, and hospitals.
Section 5:	The symptoms of Coronavirus 2019.

I also brought in a header section, proceeded by a footer section. I also incorporated images, and various videos, that both Government and Medical teams, updated us on all aspects of the progression of the Coronavirus 19. 

Home Page

I decided on the homepage. I will use sub-sections, and then my main headings. This gives a better, variety to my main page. I need to keep the reader interested, in all I have to offer as regards the whole impact and devastation that the Coronavirus 2019 impacted on the Irish economy. 
My main sections I created <h1></h1>. I gave them the main priority, given the fact that they created an insight into the project. 
I then created <h2></h2> for my sub-sections. 
I also implemented <p></p> into my main-sections, and I created a <hr>. I also brought in YouTube video and images. I brought in <alt> on all my images, but create awareness for people with either, visual impairment or people with disability. 

Mental Health Page 2

The second page, I created I implemented the following sections:
Working remotely from home. 
The impact that Coronavirus 2019 on people’s mental health.
The impact that Long Covid can have on a person’s mental, and physical health. I then styled my mental health page 2, with all Coronavirus 2019 headings, for example:
Long Covid
Anxiety
The Impact Coronavirus had on people’s mental health. 

I brought in you tube videos given an insight, working from home. I brought in a graph showing how the various lockdown measures had on Coronavirus 2019.

The Signup Page
I brought in an image within keeping with my project. I did my form up and styled it in CSS. I kept my consistency as regards my fonts and colours that I had chosen before I started my project. 

Responsive Website

I added responsive dimensions, to make my website responsive. I added dimensions from the header to the footer. My website now is responsive to the following:
iPad Air
