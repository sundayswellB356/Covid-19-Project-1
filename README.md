The Coronavirus 2019 And beyond!

Maeve Brophy
Introduction To My Project 1

The reasoning behind my reason for doing this project was. The impact on everyday restrictions on people’s lives. 

As humans been confined, and told to lock-down, due to a pandemic is alien to us humans. I witnessed losing loved-ones, and having to stand outside during their funeral, a very upsetting position to be in. 

I want to share with you, how this pandemic, interrupted people’s lives, not been able to have a basic commodity as a haircut. 
This Pandemic virus will go into, the history books for people who have not lived, through the pandemic. My aim is to highlight the impact:
The origins of The Coronavirus 2019
On our Front-line Staff.
The Impact of our Economy. 
The Impact of Our Mental Health during and after restrictions were lifted. 
The Long-Term affects that having the virus created. 

The Structure Section:
I setup sections in my project.
Section 1:	Where Coronavirus Originated From?
Section 2:	Our Economy and the Impact Coronavirus 19 had.
Section 3:	The Coronavirus impact on our Front-line staff, and hospitals.
Section 4:	The symptoms of Coronavirus 2019.

I also brought in a header section, proceeded by a footer section. I also incorporated images, and various videos, that both Government and Medical teams, updated us on all aspects of the progression of the Coronavirus 19. 

Home Page

I decided on the homepage. I will use sub-sections, and then my main headings. This gives a better, variety to my main page. I need to keep the reader interested, in all I have to offer as regards the whole impact and devastation that the Coronavirus 2019 impacted on the Irish economy. 
My main sections I created <h1></h1>. I gave them the main priority, given the fact that they created an insight into the project. 
I then created <h2></h2> for my sub-sections. 
I also implemented <p></p> into my main-sections, and I created a <hr>. I also brought in YouTube video and images. I brought in <alt> on all my images, but create awareness for people with either, visual impairment or people with disability. The image in the header was taken from pexels free images. 


Mental Health Page 2
("../images/2022-09-12 (7).png")
The second page, I created I implemented the following sections:
Working remotely from home. 
The impact that Coronavirus 2019 on people’s mental health.
The impact that Long Covid can have on a person’s mental, and physical health. I then styled my mental health page 2, with all Coronavirus 2019 headings, for example:
Long Covid
Anxiety
The Impact Coronavirus had on people’s mental health. 

I brought in you tube videos given an insight, working from home. I brought in a graph showing how the various lockdown measures had on Coronavirus 2019.

The Signup Page 3

I had found a red curly squiggle. I went back and checked my code. I found the answer to this issue. I needed to insert a curly brace, when I did the 
red squiggly line disappeared.
